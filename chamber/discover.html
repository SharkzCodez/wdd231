            <h2>History of Alice</h2>
            <p>Alice was originally a railway depot in 1883 called "Bandana" that experienced an economic boost through cattle shipment. When applying for a post office, the plan was to name the town "Kleberg" after Robert Justus Kleberg, however, there was another town named Kleberg already. The town was instead named "Alice" after Alice Gertrudis King Kleberg, Robert Justus Kleberg Jr.'s wife and the daughter of Richard and Henrietta King. In the 1940s, petroleum was found underneath the town, causing a slight population boom.</p>

            <h2>Alice Culture</h2>
            <p>While Alice is a small town, it had a big cultural impact on Tejano music, being called the "Birthplace of Tejano Music" despite its origins in Northern Mexico. The first recording company to produce exclusively Tejano music, Ideal Records, was based in Alice and helped spread the genre of music to a wider audience. Alice is also the birthplace of two Nobel Prize winners, Robert F. Curl Jr. and James P. Allison who won for chemistry and medicine respectively.</p>
